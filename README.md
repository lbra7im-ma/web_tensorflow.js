# TensorFlow.js

TensorFlow.js is an open-source machine learning library that can run anywhere JavaScript can. It is based on the original TensorFlow library written in Python and aims to recreate this developer experience and set of APIs for the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Where Can It Be Used?

Given the portability of JavaScript, TensorFlow.js allows you to write in one language and perform machine learning across various platforms:

- **Client-side in the web browser** using vanilla JavaScript.
- **Server-side and IoT devices** like Raspberry Pi using Node.js.
- **Desktop apps** using Electron.
- **Native mobile apps** using React Native.

TensorFlow.js supports multiple backends within each of these environments (e.g., CPU, WebGL) to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. Note that a "backend" in this context refers to the hardware-based environment in which the code executes, such as the GPU or CPU, not a server-side environment.

### Supported Backends:

- **WebGL**: Executes on the device's graphics card (GPU). This is the fastest way to run larger models (over 3MB) with GPU acceleration.
- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: Executes on CPU, improving performance on a wide range of devices, including older mobile phones. This is better suited for smaller models (less than 3MB) which may run faster on CPU with WASM than on GPU with WebGL.
- **CPU**: The fallback option if none of the other environments are available. It is the slowest of the three but is always available.

You can choose to force a specific backend if you know the device on which you will be running your model, or you can let TensorFlow.js automatically select the best option.

## Client-Side Super Powers

Running TensorFlow.js in the web browser offers several benefits:

- **Privacy**: You can train and classify data on the client machine without sending data to a third-party server. This is crucial for compliance with local laws like GDPR or for processing sensitive data that users may want to keep private.

- **Speed**: Without the need to send data to a remote server, inference (data classification) can be faster. Additionally, you can access device sensors like the camera, microphone, GPS, and accelerometer directly, provided the user grants permission.

- **Reach and Scale**: Anyone in the world can click a link, open the web page in their browser, and utilize your machine learning model without needing a complex server-side setup.

- **Cost**: Without servers, your only expense is a CDN to host your HTML, CSS, JS, and model files. A CDN is much cheaper than maintaining a server, especially one with a GPU, 24/7.

## Server-Side Features

Leveraging the Node.js implementation of TensorFlow.js enables the following features:

- **Full CUDA Support**: On the server side, you can install NVIDIA CUDA drivers to enable TensorFlow to work with the GPU, providing faster training and inference times. This setup delivers performance on par with the Python TensorFlow implementation, as both share the same C++ backend.

- **Model Size**: For cutting-edge models from research, you might work with models that are gigabytes in size. Such models cannot currently run in the web browser due to memory limitations. Instead, you can use Node.js on a server with the necessary hardware specifications to run these models efficiently.

- **IoT**: Node.js is supported on popular single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi, allowing you to execute TensorFlow.js models on these devices.

- **Speed**: Node.js benefits from just-in-time compilation, leading to potential performance gains, especially for preprocessing tasks. For example, Hugging Face used Node.js to achieve a 2x performance boost for their natural language processing model.

## Getting Started

Now that you understand the basics of TensorFlow.js, where it can run, and some of its benefits, it's time to start building and deploying your own machine learning models with it!
